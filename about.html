            <p>Ashley Arciniega was born in 1993 and grew up in Plainfield, Illinois. Her love for art started at a young age when her cousin, Ruben, 
                introduced her to Frida Kahlo. She would spend all her free time drawing and painting portraits, spending hours studying every corner 
                of a picture and trying to create a perfect replica. Creating a drawing that could be just as realistic as a photo intrigued her so much: 
                at the same time, abstraction was so interesting. The fact that the human mind could create such things was fascinating. 
                Today, her favorite artists include:</p>
            <ul class="artist-list">
                <li><span>Ivan Albright</span></li>
                <li><span>Claude Monet</span></li>
                <li><span>Pablo Picasso</span></li>
                <li><span>Salvador Dali</span></li>
                <li><span>Vincent Van Gogh</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The realism of Ivan Albright, the beautiful colors and delicate nature of Monet's paintings, and the abstraction of Picasso and Dali 
                were some of her most prominent forms of inspiration. Now, she hopes to share the most inspiring pieces she has seen.
