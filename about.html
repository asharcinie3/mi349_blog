        <img src="AuthorImage.jpg" alt="Image of the Author">

        <p>Ashley Arciniega was born in 1993 and grew up in Plainfield, Illinois. Her love for art started at a young age when her cousin, Ruben, introduced her to Frida Kahlo.
            She would spend all her free time drawing and painting portraits of animals and her favorite celebrities. She would spend hours drawing, studying a pictures every corner,
            trying to create a perfect replica. Something about creating a drawing that could be just as realistic as picture intrigued her so much. At the same time, abstraction 
            was so interesting. The fact that the human mind could create such things was facinating.
            This is why she loved Frida Khalo. Today, her favorite artists include:</p>
        <ul class="artist-list">
            <li><span>Ivan Albright</span></li>
            <li><span>Claude Monet</span></li>
            <li><span>Pablo Picasso</span></li>
            <li><span>Salvador Dali</span></li>
            <li><span>Vincent Van Gogh</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The realism of Ivan Albright, the beautiful colors and delicate nature of Monet's painting, and the abstraction of Picasso and Dali 
            where some of her biggest forms of inspiratiom. Now, she hopes to share the most inspiring pieces she has seen.
