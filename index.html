            <p> From 1901 to 1904, Pablo Picasso created a series of monochromatic oil paintings known as The Blue Perio, restricting himself to cold, monochromatic, blue-toned colors. Many paintings of this period depicted the 
                life of the poor, the ill, and the homeless. He expressed human misery and alienation and reflected on his experience of poverty. Being penniless most of 1902, he knew what it felt like to live a life of less. 
                Some of his most famous works during this period:

            <p class="picasso-flex" id="big-text">His most famous piece is The Old Guitarist, which was painted when he was living in the streets of Spain. The Spanish influence in this piece is seen in how The Old Guitarist 
                is positioned. He is sitting unnaturally, with his body leading one way and his legs another. You can particularly see the influence of the great 16th-century artist El Greco. The cool-toned colors show a feeling 
                of sorrow and sadness. Picasso poured all those feelings into his work which you can feel just by looking at the collection of his paintings from this period. Before creating The Old Guitarist, Picasso's dear friend, 
                Carlos Casagema, had just committed suicide. Feeling guilty for not having been there to support his friend, Picasso fell deep into depression. This depression lasted well past his Blue Period into his Cubist Era.

            <p class="big-text2">One of Frida Khalo's most famous paintings is The Two Fridas, influenced by Theodore Chasseriau's, The Two Sisters. She painted this shortly after her divorce from artist Diego Rivera. It depicts two 
                versions of herself holding hands, representing her dual heritage: her father was German, and her mother was Mexican. One version is more traditionally dressed in a Tehuana costume and with a broken heart, while the 
                other is in a more modern dress with a whole heart. A vein connects both hearts. Both are needed to complete her most accurate self-portrait.  </p>

            <p class="big-text2">The Mexican Frida is holding a picture of Diego, while the German Frida is holding forceps with blood dripping down. These represent the difficulties in her life. She had many medical procedures and
                 was not in the best health then, explaining the forceps. The broken heart and picture of Diego represent a missing piece of herself and the difficulties in her marriage. In the background, there's a dark sky, which 
                 expresses her inner turmoil. While Frida initially said this painting depicted a memory of an imaginary friend, she later admitted that this painting told the story of her loneliness after the separation from her husband.</p>
