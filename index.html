            <p> From 1901 to 1904, Pablo Picasso created a series of monochromatic oil paintings know as The Blue Period. During the Blue Period, Picasso restricted himself to cold, monochromatic, blue toned colors.
                He depicted human misery, alieniation, and reflected his own experience of poverty. Many paintings depicted the life of the poor, the ill, and the homeless. 
                Being penniless most of 1902, he knew what it felt like to live a life of less. While depression started Picasso's blue period, unfortunately it
                was said to have continued well into his cubist era. Some of his most famous works during this period:

            <p class="picasso-flex" id="big-text">His most famous piece is The Old Guitarist, as seen to the left, which was painted when he was living in the streets of Spain. You can see the Spanish influence in this piece by the way The Old 
                Guitarist is positioned in a disoriented way, with his body leading one way and his legs another. You can particulary see the influence of the great 16th-century artist El Greco. 
                The cool toned colors show a sorrow and sadness, which came after the suicide of his dear friend, Carlos Casagema. Feeling guilty for not having been 
                there to support his friend, Picasso fell deep into depression. He poured all those feelings into his work which you can feel just by looking at the collection of his paintings from this period. 
                Today his pieces of work are scattered around the world.

            <p id="big-text">One of Frida Khalo's most famous paintings is The Two Fridas, influenced by Theodore Chasseriau's The Two Sisters. She painted this shortly after her divorce with artist Diego Rivera. It depicts two 
                different versions of herself holding hands. It is said to represent her dual heritage as her father was German and her mother Mexican. One is more traditionally dressed in a Tehuana costume and with 
                a broken heart, while the other is in a more modern dress with a complete heart. Both hearts are connected by a vein. This is to show that both sides of her is needed to complete her true self portrait. 
                The Mexican Frida is holding a picture of Diego, while the German Frida is holding forceps with blood dripping down. It is said that these represent the difficulties in her life. She had many medical 
                procedures in her life and was not in the best health at the time. The open broken heart and picture of Diego represents a missing piece of herself and the difficulties in her marriage. In the background 
                there's a dark sky, which can be seen to express her inner turmoil. While Frida initially said this painting depicted a memory of an imaginary friend, she later admitted that this painting expressed her 
                loneliness after her separation with her husband. </p>
