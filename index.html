    <p>From 1901 to 1904, Pablo Picasso created a series of monochromatic images know as The Blue Period. During the Blue Period, Picasso restricted himself to cold, monochromatic blue toned colors.
        He depicted human misery, alieniation, and reflected his own experience of poverty. Many paintings depicted the life of the poor, the ill, and the homeless. 
        Being penniless most of 1902, he knew what it felt like to live a life of less. While depression started Picasso's blue period, unfortunately it
        was said to have continued well into his cubist era.</p>
    <p>His most famous piece is The Old Guitarist, as seen above, which was painted when he was living in the streets of Spain. You can see the Spanish influence in this piece by the way The Old 
        Guitarist is positioned in a disoriented way, with his body leading one way and his legs another. You can particulary see the influence of the great 16th-century artist El Greco. 
        The cool toned colors show a sorrow and sadness, which came after the suicide of his dear friend, Carlos Casagema. Feeling guilty for not having been 
        there to support his friend, Picasso fell deep into depression. He poured all those feelings into his work and you can sense that sadness and sorrow in the paintings from this period.</p>
